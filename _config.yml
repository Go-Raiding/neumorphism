about_me_description: The survey is of great importance as it addresses the consequences of Niantic Labs implementing remote raid limitations and price increases, which can effectively exclude a significant portion of the community from participating in raids. Moreover, Niantic Labs' encouragement for players to engage in in-person raids is likely to result in some players using cars to travel between raids. By collecting data through this survey and presenting it in the data visualization below, awareness can be raised regarding the impact of Niantic Labs' decision on inclusiveness, social impact, diversity, and carbon emissions. This information has the potential to guide future decisions, address concerns raised by the community, and provide relevant customer intelligence for media companies and investors.
